# SpotMicro
This is a spot micro project I Have been working on, not sure if it works It uses Arduino Mega 2560 ,Its coded in python, For the manual control it will use the Rii 2.4GHz Mini Wireless Keyboard,For object detection is will use HC-SR04 sensor and will stop if it get too close,It will also use Standard HiTEC HS-311 servos It also will use HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, It also will use 1K Ohm resistors,Use this code however you want just give me credit 

To install these packages go into Terminal and type:

`pip install SpotMicro`

Then make a new py file in VS code and type:

` from SpotMicro import SpotManualDrive.py `

and:

` from SpotMicro import SpotMain `

And Last:

` From SpotMicro import SpotManualDriveMovements `

Tehn run one of them. To Control Spot using SpotMain use the number in the code to make Spot Do things. To control spot with SpotManualMovents use the 2.4GHz mini wireless keyboard.
